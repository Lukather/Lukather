- 👋 Hi, I’m Lorenzo Strambi aka @lukather
- 👀 I’m an avid gamer since 1985 (more than 30 years ago...)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unity and/or Godot (still have to decide which is better) and also reading lots of interesting stuff about game design.
- 💞️ I was very active on Twitter (@lukather) sharing the love for #indiegames and #indiegamedev but now Musk trash it. So you can find me on Mastodon and Bluesky
- 📫 You can reach me here https://linktr.ee/Lukatherlive
